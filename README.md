<img src="/fig1.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; max-width: 200px;">

## Project Overview

This project involves developing a vision-based language model to monitor construction site progress and safety conditions. By integrating computer vision and natural language processing, the project provides a comprehensive analysis of construction sites to ensure ongoing progress and adherence to safety protocols.
### Key Features

- **Vision-Based Language Model:** Combines computer vision and natural language processing to analyze and interpret visual data from construction sites.
- **Progress Monitoring:** Tracks construction site progress through visual analysis, providing updates on work completion and status.
- **Safety Monitoring:** Detects and reports safety conditions to ensure compliance with safety regulations and identify potential hazards.
- **Comprehensive Site Analysis:** Offers a detailed view of both progress and safety conditions for effective site management.
